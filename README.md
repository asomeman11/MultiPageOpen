# MultiPageOpen
Allows you to open multiple browser pages of a youtube livestream to test a system

I decied to make this script to test browser lag and maybe even stress the wifi/NIC in laptops and destops. 
If you want to change the website or youtube link, just change the URL in the script. 
This will only work with Google Chrome because it sets a flag in chrome to auto play the videos on mute (Otherwise you have to manually start them)
